      <h3>Blondies</h3>
      <p>time / 72 mins</p>
      <p>
We’ve fallen in love with blondies. They are so easy to make — we’re pretty sure they’re one of the simplest, tastiest baked goods you can make. Not only that, but they are practically no-fail. Just a few ingredients, a bowl and a spoon. This recipe makes blondies that are perfectly dense with a paper-thin crinkly top. They are complex with lots of vanilla and dark brown sugar.  They taste like deep, rich buttery caramel. Keep them simple or customize. Add chocolate, nuts, flavorings, booze — whatever.

      <p>yield / 10 squares</p>
      <ul>
      <li>8 tablespoons (115 grams or 1 stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 cup (215 grams) lightly packed dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract, optional</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>method</h3>
      <p>
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 8-inch by 8-inch metal baking pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
      </p>
      <p>
In a medium bowl, stir melted butter and brown sugar until blended. Add the egg, vanilla, almond extract (optional) and salt then stir vigorously until smooth. When the batter looks well blended, add the flour and stir until fully incorporated, then beat with the wooden spoon or spatula for 40 to 50 strokes. (The batter will be quite thick). Beat vigorously here. You want to see the batter pulling away from the sides of the bowl. Stir in chocolate chip, nuts or dried fruit (if using).
      </p>
      <p>
Spread the batter evenly in lined pan and bake 20 to 25 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out relatively clean. Cool then cut into 16 squares.
